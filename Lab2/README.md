# Laboratory 2: Combinational Circuits

## Introduction
In this laboratory work, we'll explore various combinational circuit designs. Participants will employ the VI script utilized in Lab 1 to transmit and receive signals from the circuits under consideration.

## Lab Materials
1. NI SC 2075
2. ICs: 74HC00 or 74HCT00, 74HC155, 74HC151 Mux
3. Wires, pliers

## Concept

- Design and realization of a circuit from scratch, i.e., a Majority voter circuit.
- Design a circuit using only NAND gates.
- Investigate the logic behavior of various ICs, namely:
  - 74HC151 Multiplexer
  - 74HC155 Decoder

## Preparation
1. Obtain the datasheets of each IC from the web or a databook.
2. For all your circuits, make sure to illustrate the complete circuit including pin, ground and Vcc connections, etc. Hand-drawn circuits or printouts from your Multisim design can be used.
3. Design a 3-input majority circuit using NAND gates with a minimal number of ICs.
4. Implement the given f1 and f2 functions using a 74HC155 decoder IC and external NAND gates.
5. Design the given f1 and f2 functions using a 74HC151 Multiplexer IC.

## Lab Tasks
1. Utilize the VI script to input signals to your circuit and to get output signals from your circuit.
2. Test the 3-input majority circuit as designed exhaustively.
3. Test your circuit implemented to realize the f1 and f2 functions with a decoder exhaustively.
4. Test the circuit you've implemented to realize f1 and f2 functions with a multiplexer exhaustively.
