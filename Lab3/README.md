# LABORATORY 3 – SEQUENTIAL CIRCUITS

## 9.1 LAB MATERIALS

- NI SC-2075
- ICs: 74HC00, 74HC74
- Lots of wires

## 9.2 CONCEPT

This laboratory is designed to provide hands-on experience with D flip-flops. 

**In this lab, the following will be achieved:**
- Designing and realizing a D latch circuit using NAND gates
- Designing and realizing a 2-bit shift register using 74HC74 D-flip-flop IC
- Repeating an 8-bit shift register implementation in FPGA that is already prepared

The lab will consist of two parts:
1. The first part involves designing circuits using off-the-shelf IC‟s
2. In the second part, an FPGA board is used to experiment with the same circuits but implemented through FPGA programming.

## 9.3 PREPARATION

Ensure to have the datasheets of each IC either from the web or a databook. All circuits should include pin, ground, and Vcc connections. The circuits can be either hand-drawn or a printout from Multisim design. 

## 9.4 IN LAB

This section is divided into two main parts - dealing with IC components and using the FPGA board.
