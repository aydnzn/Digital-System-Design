# Digital System Design Laboratory 

This repository contains laboratory materials. The course covers implementations of combinational and sequential digital circuits using discrete integrated circuits (IC) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with the introduction of VHDL.

The course is structured with 7 labs and 1 hardware lab project that introduces digital circuits and Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools. The labs use advanced computer integrated virtual instrumentation hardware and software from National Instruments and advanced field-programmable logic chips and boards with the associated PC-based design software from the Xilinx and Digilent corporations.

## Hardware Lab Project

This is a culminating project where students are tasked to design and implement a digital circuit of their own choosing. Students are required to present a functional demo and submit a project report detailing their design process and implementation.
